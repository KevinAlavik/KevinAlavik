I am passionate about networking and low-level programming, especially using C and working with the Linux kernel. I have experience in kernel development and building operating systems, where I dive into how computers work at their core. I am most comfortable with the x86_64 architecture, which I’ve used a lot. I’ve also tried creating my own virtual architectures, but those didn’t work out, though I learned a lot from them. Most of my projects are experiments and often unfinished, as I focus on learning and exploring.
